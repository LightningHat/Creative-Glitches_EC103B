        <h1>Training Splits</h1>
        <p>
            Training splits are a popular way to organize your workouts throughout the week. They involve dividing your muscle groups into different training days to allow for adequate rest and recovery. Common training splits include full body, upper/lower body, and push/pull/legs.

            Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, finding the right training split can help you achieve your fitness goals more efficiently.
